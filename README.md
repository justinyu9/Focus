# Focus
Focus is a light-hearted productivity application that is typically designed for students. 

The app integrates a childhood memory with productivity. The motivation of this app was to add “fun” to tasks that users set up. We wanted students and users to have something to look forward to while they are completing their tasks. This app is designed for multi-tasking and has an interesting dynamic between the user and the app. It’s designed in a way where less interaction between user and their phone would actually reward the user.
